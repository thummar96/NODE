            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Formal education or formal learning usually takes place in the premises
                of the school,
                where a person may learn basic, academic, or trade skills. Small children often attend
                a nursery or kindergarten but often formal education begins in elementary school and
                continues with secondary school.
                Post-secondary education (or higher education) is usually at a college or university
                which may grant an academic degree. It is associated with a specific or stage and is
                provided under a certain set of rules and regulations.
                The formal education is given by specially qualified teachers they are supposed to be
                efficient in the art of instruction. It also observes strict discipline. The student and the
                teacher both are aware of the facts and engage themselves in the process of education.</p>

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Informal education may be a parent teaching a child how to prepare a
                meal or ride a
                bicycle.
                People can also get an informal education by reading many books from a library or
                educational websitesInformal education is when you are not studying in a school and
                do not use any particular learning method. In this type of education, conscious efforts
                are not involved. It is neither pre-planned nor deliberate. It may be learned at some
                marketplace, hotel or at home.
                Unlike formal education, informal education is not imparted by an institution such as
                school or college. Informal education is not given according to any fixed timetable.
                There is no set curriculum required. Informal education consists of experiences and
                actually living in the family or community</p>

                education or
                school equivalency preparation.
                In non-formal education, someone (who is not in school) can learn literacy, other
                basic skills or job skills.
                Home education, individualised instruction (such as programmed learning), distance
                learning and computer-assisted instruction are other possibilities.
                Non-formal education is imparted consciously and deliberately and systematically
                implemented. It should be organised for a homogeneous group. Non-formal,
                education should be programmed to serve the needs of the identified group. This will
                necessitate flexibility in the design of the curriculum and the scheme of evaluation. </p>
