        String.prototype.repeat()
            The repeat() method constructs and returns a new string which contains the specified number of copies of the string 
            on which it was called, concatenated together.

                repeat(count)

        Example :=
                let chorus = 'Node ';
                console.log(chorus.repeat(5));                                      //      Node Node Node Node Node
