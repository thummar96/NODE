        String.prototype.includes()
            The includes() method performs a case-sensitive search to determine whether one string may be found within another string, 
            returning true or false as appropriate.

        Syntax  :=
                includes(searchString)
                includes(searchString, position)

        Example :=
                let sentence = 'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.';
                let word = 'kinjal';
                console.log(`The word "${word}" ${sentence.includes(word)
                            ? 'is' : 'is not'} in the sentence`);                     //  The word "kinjal" is not in the sentence
